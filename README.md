# Health Connect - Survivors to Saviors 

## Introduction


Our app is a comprehensive platform designed to connect individuals battling similar illnesses, providing them with support, information, and a sense of community. Users can securely sign up or log in to access a user-friendly Home Page that serves as the gateway to various key features, including Group Chatting, Video Calling, and Blog Posting. The app integrates an advanced ML-driven Medical Recommendations system, offering predictive insights based on users' symptoms, along with tailored medication and workout routines. The Group Chatting and Video Calling features foster real-time communication and face-to-face interactions, allowing users to share experiences, receive guidance, and offer mutual support. Additionally, the Blog section provides a space for survivors to share their journeys, offering hope and valuable advice to others facing similar challenges. This project aims to create a supportive community where users can find the help and encouragement they need to manage their health and well-being.
